# Interactive-Food-Pyramid
This was my first project using **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.</br> 
The assigned task was to develop an **Interactive Food Pyramid chart**.</br></br>

## What to expect
 - By default, each section of the food pyramid is set to the amount required for each day in order to maintain a healthy, balanced diet.</br>
 - There also exists a guide describing what foods are included in each category.</br>
 - Users can record the number of foods consumed for any given day by interacting with the plus and minus buttons on a section of the pyramid.</br>
